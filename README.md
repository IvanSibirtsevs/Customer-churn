# Outflow of bank customers

Clients began to leave Beta-Bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones.
It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. I have been provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.
Build a model with an extremely large F1-measure. It is necessary to bring the metric to 0.59.
